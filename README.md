# odinbook

The Odin Project's [Final Rails Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project).

This is a fully functional social network in the Facebook mold, with friending, likes, comments, the works. You can see it in action on [Heroku](https://velez-odinbook.herokuapp.com/).

Make sure Javascript is enabled on your browser (i.e. if you're running NoScript), but if you're reading this, I probably don't have to tell you that.
I only discovered how dependent this app is on it when Heroku suddenly didn't feel like working.

Implements the following:

1. ~~PostgreSQL database.~~
2. ~~Root sign-in page.~~
3. ~~Signing in via [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).~~
4. ~~Friend requests!~~
5. ~~...that require confirmation!~~
6. ~~...with notifications in the navbar.~~
7. ~~Also, a navbar.~~
8. ~~User created posts!~~
9. ~~...that can be liked!~~
10. ~~...and commented upon!~~
11. ~~Posts should display content, the author, comments, and likes.~~
12. ~~A Facebook-esque Timeline, with recent posts made by the current user and their friends.~~
13. ~~User profiles, with a Gravatar photo.~~
14. ~~Profiles should **show** their profile info, photo, and posts.~~
15. ~~An **index** containing users, with buttons for sending/accepting friend requests and pagination.~~
16. ~~Sign-in via [OmniAuth](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/OmniAuth:-Overview), allowing a user to sign-in through Facebook.~~
17. ~~A mailer, sending a welcome e-mail for new users and a password retrieval e-mail.~~
18. ~~[SendGrid](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sendgrid) to actually send the e-mails.~~
19. ~~Posts that can accept images!~~
20. ~~...and can also be uploaded from the client's computer via [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip).~~
21. ~~Polymorphic association, which allows users to comment/like posts and photos without (much) extra code.~~ (Unnecessary)
22. ~~CSS styling throughout!~~
